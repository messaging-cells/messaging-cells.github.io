<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Messaging-Cells is:

<ol>
<li>
A personal project. Not alpha (usable) yet.
<li>
A software library.
<li>
A sublanguage of c++ as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language" target="blank"> DSL </a>.
<li>
A minimalistic asynchronous messaging aproach to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)" target="blank">concurrency</a> and parallelism.
<li>
Free Software and Open Source Software with a GNU C/C++ license.
<li>
Developed to work over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads" target="blank">pthreads</a> and to generate 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog" target="blank">Verilog</a> code for the user's running pthread model.
<li>
Inspired by the ideas of the 
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/cell-signaling/mechanisms-of-cell-signaling/a/introduction-to-cell-signaling" target="blank">
biological cell communication</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="blank">Actor Model</a>, the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_object-oriented_programming" target="blank">Concurrent object-oriented programming</a> paradigm, and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface#MPI-2_concepts" target="blank">MPI-2</a> standard.
</ol>

<p>
The library is just a personal project of a modeling library for concurrent algorithms with many concurrent pieces of software (cells). 

<p>
The motivation for this software is to have a base library to implement a parallel algorithm for <a href="https://ben-jose.github.io/" target="blank">Ben-Jose SAT Solver</a>.

<h1>Status</h1>

<p>
Not alpha yet. Working on the DSL and the generation of verilog code. This means the whole code base is very unstable.

<h1>General features so far</h1>
<ol>
<li>
Deterministic behaviour. No indeterminism. Unlike the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="blank">Actor Model</a>. For a any pair of cells Cell_A and Cell_B:
	<ul>
	<li>
	A message sent by Cell_A is always received by Cell_B only once.
	<li>
	Messages are always received by Cell_B in the same order they are sent by Cell_A.
	<li>
	Message disposal is handled by the system and the user cannot modify it once it has been sent.
	</ul>
<li>
No locks at all for synchronization (no mutexes, no semaphores, etc). Like the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="blank">Actor Model</a>.
<li>
Asynchronous messaging. Like the Actor Model.
<li>
Unlike the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model#Unbounded_nondeterminism_controversy" target="blank">
Actor Model</a>, Messaging-Cells has a 
<a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~srollins/courses/cs682-s08/web/notes/timeandstates.html" target="blank">global state</a> meaning it is a deterministically debuggable model.
</ol>
