<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Messaging Cells is:

<ol>
<li>
A personal project. Not alpha (usable) yet.
<li>
A software library.
<li>
A sublanguage of c++ as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language" target="blank"> DSL </a>.
<li>
A minimalistic asynchronous messaging aproach to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)" target="blank">concurrency</a> and parallelism.
<li>
Free Software and Open Source Software with a GNU C/C++ license.
<li>
Developed to work over: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads" target="blank">pthreads</a> and to generate 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog" target="blank">Verilog</a> code for the user's running pthread model.
<li>
Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="blank">Actor Model</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_object-oriented_programming">Concurrent object-oriented programming</a>.
</ol>

<p>
The library is just a personal project of a modeling library for concurrent algorithms with many concurrent pieces of software (cells). 

<p>
The motivation for this software is to have a base library to implement a parallel algorithm for <a href="https://ben-jose.github.io/" target="blank">Ben-Jose SAT Solver</a>.

<h1>Status</h1>

<p>
Not alpha yet. Working on the DSL and the verilog generation of code and this means the whole code base is very unstable.

<h1>General features so far</h1>
<ol>
<li>
Deterministic behaviour. No indeterminism. Unlike the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="blank">Actor Model</a>. For a any pair of cells Cell_A and Cell_B:
	<ul>
	<li>
	A message sent by Cell_A is always received by Cell_B only once.
	<li>
	Messages are always received by Cell_B in the same order they are sent by Cell_A.
	<li>
	Message disposal is handled by the system and the user cannot modify it once it has been sent.
	</ul>
<li>
No locks at all for synchronization (no mutexes, no semaphores, etc). Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="blank">Actor Model</a>.
<li>
Asynchronous messaging. Like the Actor Model.
</ol>

<h1>Code</h1>

<p>
The source code is available in the github <a href="https://github.com/messaging-cells/messaging-cells">repository</a>.
