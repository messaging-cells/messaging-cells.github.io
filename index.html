<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Messaging Cells is:

<ol>
<li>
A GNU C/C++ software library.
<li>
A minimalistic asynchronous messaging aproach to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)" target="blank">concurrency</a> and parallelism.
<li>
Free Software and Open Source Software.
<li>
For the <a href="http://www.adapteva.com/epiphany-multicore-intellectual-property/">Epiphany</a> architecture (<a href="https://www.parallella.org/" target="blank">Parallella_E3</a> board only for now) of <a href="http://www.adapteva.com" target="blank">Adapteva</a>.
<li>
Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="blank">Actor Model</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_object-oriented_programming">Concurrent object-oriented programming</a>.
</ol>

<p>
The library is designed to be used as a support library for applications or libraries that need to comunicate concurrent pieces of software in an <a href="http://www.adapteva.com/epiphany-multicore-intellectual-property/">Epiphany</a> based system (<a href="https://www.parallella.org/" target="blank">Parallella_E3</a> board only for now). 

<p>
The expected user is a C/C++ programmer that needs to implement a parallel algorithm. 

<p>
The motivation for this software is to have a base librery to implement the new parallel algorithm of <a href="https://ben-jose.github.io/" target="blank">Ben-Jose SAT Solver</a>.

<h1>Status</h1>

<p>
A first alpha version is running basic examples. It is planned to be refined and expanded as needed during the implementation of the parallel version of the <a href="https://ben-jose.github.io/" target="blank">Ben-Jose</a> algorithm. That means that, if futures or anything else are not needed for that algorithm, you are wellcome to implement your needed/wanted feature for the library.

<h1>Features</h1>

<ol>
<li>
Small in-core footprint (8Kb including code + stack).
<li>
Loads in parallel (loading tree definable in your code).
<li>
Your code can be partinioned in loadable modules that run in-core.
<li>
Deterministic behaviour. No indeterminism. Unlike the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="blank">Actor Model</a>. For a any pair of cells Cell_A and Cell_B:
	<ul>
	<li>
	A message sent by Cell_A is always received by Cell_B only once.
	<li>
	Messages are always received by Cell_B in the same order they are sent by Cell_A.
	<li>
	Cell_A (sending) always does local core writing and Cell_B (receiving) always does remote core reading. No message copying.
	</ul>
<li>
Cell references are just Epiphany addresses (you must be address aware).
<li>
Optimized dynamic memory allocation/deallocation (pools of reusable classes).
<li>
Every library object is local-core dynamically groupable (see class binder). Local core complex structures (trees, graphs) can be constructed with the base classes of the library.
<li>
Configurable in-core RAM memory usage from link script (see examples).
<li>
Designed for eMesh Network usage for messaging and synchronization (as opposed to off-core memory usage).
<li>
No locks at all for synchronization (no mutexes, no semaphores, etc). Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="blank">Actor Model</a>.
<li>
Asynchronous massaging. Like the Actor Model.
<li>
Single user epiphany usage oriented (it is assumed that your code will be the only one running in the epiphany architecture).
<li>
Debugging tools:
	<ul>
	<li>
	Per-core synchronized logs (if it is not in the log it has not happened in the core).
	<li>
	Epiphany backtrace function to know your stack state.
	</ul>
<li>
Emulating library (based on threads) to develop and debug without the epiphany architecture. You can develop in a "normal" linux and then run in the Parallella.
<li>
Host side implementation of the system can/may do all io to the epiphany architecture in a consistent way. That is: Messaging cells in the host (Zynq side) can/may communicate back and forth with messaging cells in the epiphany (E3 side) to do all io to the epiphany.
</ol>

<h1>Bare metal programming</h1>

<p>
Despite all these wonderful features. You still are supposed to understand the epiphany architecture. You still are supposed to know exactly what is happening with your code even at machine level (epiphany assembler level) and how the emulating library works if you are using it. 

<p>
The user is expected to be aware of the kind of addressing been used for a library object at any given time.

<p>
Whether it is: 

<ul>
<li>
From the epiphany side (hardware addresses).
	<ol>
	<li>
	local-core. 
		<ul>
		<li>
		Zero based (without core id).
		<li>
		With local core id.
		</ul>
	<li>
	remote-core. 
	<li>
	off-core (outside of the epiphany system in the shared mem with the host)
	</ol>
<li>
From the host side (linux virtual addresses mapped to hardware addresses).
	<ol>
	<li>
	in-core. Inside the RAM of a core of the epiphany system (no register mem). 
	<li>
	off-core 
	</ol>
</ul>

<p>
The library provides functions to map all of these kinds of addressing, but the user must be aware of his own use of them and of course there is no protection against steping on your own toes (writing the wrong address).

<p>
It is bare metal programing with abstraction.

<h1>Recommended Use</h1>

<p>
The recommended use for this library is in the implementation of discrete mathematics parallel algorithms because these kind of algorithms will not need much use of memory outside of the Epiphany-system (neither in code nor in data). They can be implemented just using the Epiphany system (core's RAM and the eMesh Network) by partitioning them in loadable modules kept anywhere in memory (off-sys or form other core). And that means optimal parallel use of the system.

<h1>Download and Install</h1>

In the command line:
<pre>
	git clone https://github.com/messaging-cells/messaging-cells.git
	cd messaging-cells
	./build
</pre>

<p>
These commands will compile, built, put the library directory in the PATH environment variable, list all files of the library and finally 'exit' the command line so the changes to the path take effect (.bashrc is ran again) the next time you open a command line.

<h3>Required Software</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A Linux system.
	<li>GNU C++ (g++). 
	<li>GNU Make (Make). 
</ol>

<p>
For Mint and in the command line (probably the same for other debian based distros):

<pre>
	sudo apt-get install gcc
	sudo apt-get install g++
	sudo apt-get install make
</pre>

<p>
These commands are safe to be run even if the packages are already installed because it will just tell you so.

<h1 id="Getting-Started">Getting Started</h1>

<p>
In the command line and in a Parallella system (after installing);

<p>
To run the hello world example:
<pre>
	./hello_world.sh
</pre>

<p>
To run the eating philosophers example:
<pre>
	./philo.sh
</pre>

<p>
To run the modules example:
<pre>
	./modules.sh
</pre>

<p>
See the output of the examples:
<pre>
	cat src/tests/bin/log_*
</pre>

<p>
See the source code of examples with 

<pre>
	<a href="https://github.com/messaging-cells/messaging-cells/tree/master/src/tests" target="blank">cd src/tests</a>
</pre>.
